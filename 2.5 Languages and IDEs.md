# Key Definitions

# Types of languages
## High level languages
> A high level language is a way of programming a computer without knowing the specifics of the hardware in which the program will be running on. It is an abstracted level which allows the programmer to work in a more english-style language as opposed to 1s and 0s.
- Problem oriented, designed to help solve a particular problem without worrying about the lower levels
- Programmers can use libraries and built-in functions
- Must be interpreted or compiled ### TODO LINKS
- Allows programs to run on many devices
- A single line of code can be used to perform multiple actions

## pros
- Easier to understand, write and debug
- Portable to many devices
- Libraries and built-in functions can speed up development

## cons
- Slower than low-level languages
- Less control over how the program runs internally

## Examples
- Javascript
- Python
- Java

## Low level languages
> A low level language is one which has a direct correlation between its instructions and their binary representation (1:1). These instructions are different depending on the processor that is running the code, and so the code is not portable.
- Computer oriented, designed to work on a specific system
- Allows direct control over a systems memory, registers and components
- Efficient
- Useful in embedded systems such as a washing machine
- Useful in device drivers which interact directly with the system and peripherals

## pros
- Allows for much more efficient code (memory and speed)
- Allows for more control over how the program processes things and runs
- Great for embedded systems or systems with very limited memory

## cons
- non-portable (only works on the processor its designed for)
- More complex and harder to read, write and debug
- Programmer must create all functionality as there are no libraries and built-in functions

## Examples
- Assembly Code
- Machine Code

#### Instruction sets
> An instruction set is the set of binary codes that relate directly to different functionalities available for a processor.
- arithmetic/logic, data movement, control-flow

#### Machine code
> Machine code is the lowest level in which a program can be. It is written in 1s and 0s, tho may commonly be displayed in HEX form to make it more compact and easier to read
- Does not need to be translated in order to run
- Complex to write, read and debug

#### Assembly code
> Assembly code is a more human representation of machine code. It uses mnemonics which relate directly to a code in the instruction set of the processor
- Its equivelent to machine code but more readable
- Must be translated for the computer to understand (with an assembler)
- Uses a combination of phrases, data and memory locations
- 1:1 relationship with machine code

# Translators 
A translator converts code into a format understood by the machine (machine code)

> Compilers, interpreters and assemblers: https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/sys_trans_assembler_compiler_interpreter?examBoard=all&stage=all&topic=translators

## Compiler
> Translates source code into a form which can be executed, but does not execute the code.
- Hard to reverse engineer the code
- Once compiled can be run any number of times

## pros
- Protects source code
- Can be distributed to clients without the need for installing software to translate the code locally
- Faster to run than interpreted languages, as the code is already readable by the machine
## cons
- Must be compiled for each type of processor
- Errors are reported at the end, which can slow things down in big programs that need a lot to be compiled

## Example
The language C must be compiled using a compiler like GCC and then the resulting output can be transferred to clients who can instantly run their code

#### Stages of compilation

## Resources

## Interpreter
> z

## cons
- Must convert source code then execute it, resulting in slower execution

## Assemblers
