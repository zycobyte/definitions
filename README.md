# revising
Some good methods for revising include
- writing out key information on an A4 sheet of paper and try to condense it to fit as much as you can
- taking tests on bbc bitesize
- attempting past exam papers
- ***reading mark schemes so you know what the markers look for***
- writing and messing about with code to see what happens
