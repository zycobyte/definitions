## Truth Tables
> A truth table is a type of table that ***lists all possible inputs and outputs*** for a logical expression
- The number of rows will always be 2 to the power of the number of inputs
- True may be represented as 1, ON or YES
- False may be represented as 0, OFF or NO
- Middle steps can be labled to save space

##### Pros
- Good for testing logical expressions
- Easy to read especially with more complex expressions
- Easier to notice patterns
##### Cons
- Can get large very quickly
- May be time consuming

## Logic Cirvuits
> A logic circuit uses symbols to represent AND, OR and NOT and lines to connect them, as opposed to the words and brackets used in a formula
