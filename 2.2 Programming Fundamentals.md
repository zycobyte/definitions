***BOLD ITALIC*** - key words

# Key Definitions


## Sub Programs
> A ***smaller program*** written ***within or imported*** into a ***larger program*** that performs a ***specific task*** and can be ***run any number of times***.
- The two types of programs are [procedures](https://github.com/zycobyte/definitions/blob/master/2.2%20Programming%20Fundamentals.md#procedure) and [functions](https://github.com/zycobyte/definitions/blob/master/2.2%20Programming%20Fundamentals.md#function)
- When the sub program is complete the main program continues

##### Pros
- Easier to write, test and debug
- Can be saved seperately and re-used
- Writing code once and re-using it saves time
##### Cons
- Must be tested independently and as a part of the whole system

#### Example
Built in sub programs exist in python, such as the int and str functions which can be called anywhere within a program to convert a string to a number or a number to a string

## Procedure
> A procedure is a ***block of code*** that is called to ***perform a specific task***.
- does ***NOT*** return a value

##### Pros
- Allows you to organise the code
- Can be called many time
- Avoid duplicating code
- Easier to fix bugs or update with new features when the functionality is called from multiple places in the codebase

#### Example
```python
def display_message(text):
    print("pretty formatting here >> ", text) #prints a formatted message

procedureOutput = display_message("test")
print(procedureOutput)
# As a procedure does not return a value, the procedureOutput variable has no value (represented by the word None in python) and so "None" is shown
```

## Function
> A function is a ***block of code*** that is called to ***perform a specific task*** and will ***return one or more values***
- returns values

##### Pros
- Allows you to organise the code
- Can be called many time
- Avoid duplicating code
- Easier to fix bugs or update with new features when the functionality is called from multiple places in the codebase

#### Example
```python
def area(width, height):
    return width * height

functionOutput = area(2,3)
print(functionOutput)
# As a function returns a value, in this case 2 * 3, the functionOutput variable has the value 6 and so 6 is shown
```

## Arithmetic Operators
> Arithmetic operators are the mathematical operators that can be performed on variables and data.
- ***a DIV b*** is integer division. It is the number of times that b can go into a. it is like doing **a/b** and rounding the number down.
- ***a MOD b*** is modulous. It is the remainder left over after performing DIV.
- if ***a MOD b == 0*** then a is a multiple of b. If the result is ***not equal to 0*** then it will always be less than b

## Relational Operators
> Relational oprerators allow for assignments and enable comparisons on variables and data
- Can be combined with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to add complexity to decisions
