***BOLD ITALIC*** - key words

# Key Definitions


## Computational Thinking
> A ***problem-solving method*** using ***computer science techniques*** such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, generalisation, and algorithms, where ***possible solutions are developed*** and presented in a way that can be ***understood by humans and computers***.
- It involves breaking down a complex problem into simple steps
- It involves problem solving, logical thinking and pattern recognition as well as evaluation
- It is not "thinking like a computer" rather "thinking in a way a computer can understand"

##### Pros
- Develops robust systems that are ***easier to maintain***
- Helps to organise codebases
- Allows you to focus on only the important parts
##### Cons
- Requires practice

#### Example
The game Guess Who is a good example of computational thinking.
You must think logically to break up the problem into a smaller and smaller group if people. You ignore any irrelevant details (such as excluded characters or details present in no characters) as you focus on finding the solution. Different questions asked (like algorithms) have different efficiencies. For example if 1/100 characters have green eyes then 99% of the time that would be a very inefficient first question to ask. A better question would be to ask about their gender presentation, as you would be able to exclude about half of the options immediately with consistent results.

## Decomposition
> The process of ***breaking down*** a ***complex problem*** into ***smaller sub-tasks*** which are ***easier to understand*** and work through.
- similar to how when an organism decomposes, it is broken down into smaller parts
- allows you to view a large task in manageble steps

##### Pros
- Helps programmers notice where code can be re-used
- Makes a problem more manageable and easier to understand
##### Cons
- Must understand the problem well to fully and efficiently decompose it
- Could lose some info or context during decomposition process

#### Example

## Abstraction
> Abstraction is the process of ***filtering out irrelevant/unnecessary characteristics/details*** of a problem to focus on what is ***important to solve the problem or reduce complexity for users***
- Allows you to generalise a problem, like calculating the area of a square, the algorithm would be written as *width \* width* to work for all squares, and then can be told what the width is at runtime.
- Allows you to hide complexity at a lower level. The user may only see the rendered screen and not worry about how the screen is rendered. Similarly a programmer may see modules that have been abstracted, so "render board" and "render objects" have their complexity hidden at a lower level in the program.

##### Pros
- Allows you to focus on what is important
- Can re-use code easily
- Can be easier to get an overview of how the system is working
##### Cons
- Software can be over-abstracted and become more complex
- Can be harder to figure out all the exact details of how a system is working

#### Example
The london underground has lots of features and details that could be added to a map. Some are not important for a user of the system when planning a journey such as the depth of a station, distance between stations or frequency of trains.

Other details are important for planning a journey such as the different lines, available stations, accessibility options or changes available.

## Algorithms
> An algorithm is a set of ***step by step instructions*** that are to be followed to ***achieve the required result***
- Can be represented as program code, [psuedo code](https://github.com/zycobyte/definitions/blob/master/2.1%20Algorithms.md#pseudo-code), [written desctiptions](https://github.com/zycobyte/definitions/blob/master/2.1%20Algorithms.md#written-descriptions) or [flow charts](https://github.com/zycobyte/definitions/blob/master/2.1%20Algorithms.md#flow-charts)
- draft program code may contain syntax errors as long as it is clear
  
##### Pros & Cons
- pros and cons are related to the efficiency of the algorithm implemented, such as speed and memory usage

#### Example
- I will add links to the searching algorithms when we go through them next week

#### Resources

## Trace Tables
> ***Tracks the changes*** of variable states throughout program execution
- If a variable does not change, a cell is left blank

##### Pros
- Allows you to step through the program execution
- Good for finding [logic errors](https://github.com/zycobyte/definitions/blob/master/computational_thinking.md#logic-error)
##### Cons
- May be time consuming

#### Example

## Flow Charts
> A ***diagram*** that represents the overview of a program. They use ***standard symbols*** to represent instructions. ***Flowcharts show a step by step solution***
- may be called a flow diagram
- please refer to the example image for the different symbols and their meaning

##### Pros
- Easy to visualise
- Internationally standardised
##### Cons
- Large problems can result in large charts
- Changes can result in a lot of editing re-formatting

#### Example

#### Resources
- Flowcharts: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z7kkw6f/revision/3

## Pseudo Code
> A way of ***describing step by step instructions*** in a code-like format
- Resembles a programming language
- Has its own syntax
- Must be converted to program code to run

##### Pros
- easy to convert to code
- simple to understand
- syntax errors not important
- easy to edit

##### Cons
- harder to see program flow
- could be time consuming

#### Example
[List of instructions](https://tools.withcode.uk/ks4pseudo/media/edexcel_pseudocode.pdf)

#### Resources
- psuedo code: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z7kkw6f/revision/2
- written, psuedo and program code: https://learnlearn.uk/edexcel-igcse-computer-science/pseudocode/

## Written Descriptions
> An algorithm is layed out as instructions in english
- short sentances
- no unnecessary details
- clear instructions

##### Pros
- no syntax
- most like english
##### Cons
- can become over-complicated
- may become more wordy or descriptive as opposed to instructional

#### Example
The program prompts the user to enter the width and height. It then calculates the area of a rectangle based on the two numbers. Finally it displays the result on the screen.

## Logic Error
> A logic error is an error in the way the program operates. It runs without any obvious errors however the results are unexpected
- They are caused by the programer either by making small mistakes or poor design
- These errors can only be found during bug testing as, according to the computer, there is nothing inherently wrong with the code written

#### Examples
- incorrect relational operators (such as < instead of >)
- incorrect logical operators (such as AND instead of OR)
- accidental infinite loops
- incorrect mathematical brackets (1+(2*3)) == 7 vs ((1+2)*3) == 9
- using the wrong variable
- poor program design
  
#### Resources
- https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zbssv9q/revision/7

## Runtime Error
> A runtime error is an error that occurs while the program is running. It usually results in a crash unless explicitly handled
- The error is detected by the system during the running of the program and a message will be printed to give info on where and what occurred

#### Examples
- Trying to open a file that does not exist
- Trying to access an array index that does not exist
- Trying to do something with a null value
- Trying to send something over the internet while the system is not connected to any network
- Trying to convert "Hello, world!" into its numeric value
Though there are many more and they can be created by you too for specific scenarios in your code

#### Resources
- https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zbssv9q/revision/7

## Syntax Error
> A syntax error is an error that occurs when the code written is incorrectly formatted with regards to how the language defines its rules.
- A computer may be able to point out where some errors are but will not be able to understand what is written until it is corrected

- its. like how ive used apostrophies in the wrong place's and have spelt words wrong in this sentance as well as missing out or mis(using) other punctuation symbles  
- Other than spelling and punctuation symbols you could have used a variable before it is declared
- Its like saying "It was a really good time going there with her" and not giving the context "I went to the theme park with mary" until after. 

#### Examples
Common examples you should look for in python include 
- ensuring all variables are declared before they are used
- all brackets are in the right places and correctly closed
- that indentation is consistent
- that there are colons in all the correct places
- that strings have consistent "" or ''
though there may be others.

# Searching Algorithms
## Binary Searcg
> Binary search is a ***very efficient*** searching algoritm that ***splits the data in half*** and checks if the value it is searching for is greater or less than the ***middle value***. It then knows if it should repeat this on the top or bottom half. When the ***middle values is equal to search term*** then it has found it. If the array gets split to a single element that is not the value, then the item was not found.
- The data ***must be ordered***
- Each iteration of the algorithm halfs the number of elements to search
- less than and greater than is obvious with numbers. With text, it may be ordered by character code (eg A is less then F and F is less than Z)
- To calculate the middle index, you do (LowestIndex + HighestIndex) DIV 2 (round decimals down)

## pros
- Very fast and efficient
  
## cons
- Data must already be in order
- more complex than linear search

## Example
Searching for card 9 from index 0 to 6. Since 0+6 DIV 2 is equal to 3, we look at card 3 first

![start](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/api/v3.5.0/api/images/content/computer_science/data_structures_and_algorithms/searching/figures/isaac_cs_dsa_search_first_mid.png)

The middle card is picked, as 6 < 9 we know we need to check the side with values greater than 6. The mid point of the new section is 4+6 DIV 2, so 5. This is because we have excluded all cards from index 0 up to and including 3.

![end](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/api/v3.5.0/api/images/content/computer_science/data_structures_and_algorithms/searching/figures/isaac_cs_dsa_search_second_mid.svg)

Of the remaining half, we select the mid-point. This card has the value of 9 and so we are done (as 9 == 9)

## Linear Search
> Linear search is a sequential algorithm that works on ***unordered or ordered*** lists. It starts with index 0 and checks each value going up until it finds the value it is searching for.


## Example
Searching for the number 4

![step1](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/api/v3.5.0/api/images/content/computer_science/data_structures_and_algorithms/searching/figures/isaac_cs_dsa_search_start_method.png)
![step2](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/api/v3.5.0/api/images/content/computer_science/data_structures_and_algorithms/searching/figures/isaac_cs_dsa_search_second_check.svg)
![step3](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/api/v3.5.0/api/images/content/computer_science/data_structures_and_algorithms/searching/figures/isaac_cs_dsa_search_third_check.svg)

# pros
- The data does not need to be ordered
- Very simple to implement

# cons
- Slow, especially on large arrays
- Must check every value if the item is not in the array

# Sorting algorithms
- Each time it goes through the list is called a pass

Efficiency visualised: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZuD6iUe3Pc

Note: only bubble, insertion and merge are required for this course

## Bubble sort
> Bubble sort ***compares two consecutive elements*** at a time. If they are in order, they are left. If they are in the wrong order they are switched. This creates an effect of bigger values 'bubbling' up to the top of the array like bubbles in a fizzy drink.
- Can be used to sort in ascending or decending order
- A sorted section forms at the end of the array

## pros
- easy to implement
- Uses the array itself for sorting, not extra memory
## cons
- not the most efficient

## Example
Please watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xli_FI7CuzA

## Resources
- Bubble sort - method - examples - efficiency: https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_search_bubble?examBoard=all&stage=all

## Insertion sort
> Insertion sort builds a sorted array from the start. The first item is always considered to be sorted, then each consecutive item is checked against the last sorted item. If its greater, it is left at the end, if not it is inserted at the correct point of the array.
- Generally faster than bubble sort as there is less writing of data

# pros
- Uses the array itself for sorting, not extra memory
- Simple to understand and implement
# cons
- not the most efficient especially with large lists

## Example
Please watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU767SDMDvA

## Resources
- Insertion sort - method - examples - efficiency: https://isaaccomputerscience.org/concepts/dsa_search_insertion?examBoard=all&stage=all

## Merge Sort
> Merge sort starts by splitting an algorithm in half repeatedly until the elements are on their own. It then groups them back together in order, doubling the size each time
- Uses sublists to hold the data
- ***"Divide and conquer"***

***NOTE: you do not need to understand recursion for GCSE, though the algorithm is usually implemented using it***

## pros
- Highly efficient (much more efficient than insertion or bubble)
- Maintains order of items with the same value

## cons
- On very small, almost ordered lists, bubble sort or insertion may be slightly faster
- More complex implementation
- Uses more memory to store data being sorted
- Must still go through whole process if data is already sorted

## examples
