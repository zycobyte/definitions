***BOLD*** - key words

# Key Definitions


## Computational Thinking
> A ***problem-solving method*** using ***computer science techniques*** such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, generalisation, and algorithms, where ***possible solutions are developed*** and presented in a way that can be ***understood by humans and computers***.
- It involves breaking down a complex problem into simple steps
- It involves problem solving, logical thinking and pattern recognition as well as evaluation
- It is not "thinking like a computer" rather "thinking in a way a computer can understand"

##### Pros
- Develops robust systems that are ***easier to maintain***
- Helps to organise codebases
- Allows you to focus on only the important parts
##### Cons
- Requires practice

#### Example
```
The game Guess Who is a good example of computational thinking. You must think logically to break up the problem into a smaller and smaller group if people. You ignore any irrelevant details (such as excluded characters or details present in no characters) as you focus on finding the solution. Different questions asked (like algorithms) have different efficiencies. For example if 1/100 characters have green eyes then 99% of the time that would be a very inefficient first question to ask. A better question would be to ask about their gender presentation, as you would be able to exclude about half of the options immediately with consistent results.

## Decomposition
> The process of ***breaking down*** a ***complex problem*** into ***smaller sub-tasks*** which are ***easier to understand*** and work through.
- similar to how when an organism decomposes, it is broken down into smaller parts
- allows you to view a large task in manageble steps

##### Pros
- Helps programmers notice where code can be re-used
- Makes a problem more manageable and easier to understand
##### Cons
- Must understand the problem well to fully and efficiently decompose it
- Could lose some info or context during decomposition process
